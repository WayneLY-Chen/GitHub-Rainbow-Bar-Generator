# GitHub-Rainbow-Bar-Generator
This Python script creates high-quality, borderless, and perfectly looped GIFs using the Pillow library. Unlike static images, it generates smooth 256-color spectrum animations.

## ✨ Key Features:
- Zero Setup: Automatically checks and installs pip install pillow if missing.
- Fully Customizable: Adjust width, height (thickness), and animation speed.
- Seamless Loop: perfectly calculated frames for a smooth infinite flow.
- Borderless: Produced specifically for GitHub 'full-width' decoration."
